Worst battery performance.Iphone 11 is far better den this..In 4 hour battery will come down from 100 to 15 percent.Please dont buy this product at this price.
"Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour  “ not bad at all and not too flashy”Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won’t comes with the phone)"
"his was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."
"Sold kidney bought this, now not feeling well but the number of days I am alive with one kidney will enjoy using this phone. Guys be careful if you rich it’s ok else sell something else but not kidney it hurts"
Nicely packed !! Kudos to seller !!I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.1.Display:Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.2.Battery:Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.PS: i dont play games.3.IOS:This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.4. Camera:The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.5 Build &Design :This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.6.Face Id:Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.7.Updates:Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software  updates thats huge !Cons:1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.2.No charger and earpods in the box.3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.Overall a great Phone IF You are OK with the Price !!!
"llo there,I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-MemoryBuild qualityCameraProcessorDisplayExcept battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!"
Same like the old classic iphone 5 lookBut now difference is only6.1 inch display or The A 14 bionic chipAnd oled Hd display
"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."
"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"
"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It’s a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple’s trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn’t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won’t be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won’t come with a SD card, won’t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won’t work with this one. Face ID won’t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you’re out and vulnerable. This phone won’t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn’t use. You won’t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won’t let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn’t cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won’t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone."
"Positives: Very fast, Picture Quality, video quality seems superb,  less charging time required.Cons: Shorter battery life than specified and expected."
"y girlfriend demanded me this iphone... And now she is uploading pics with new boyfriend 🥺with caption that ""he don't deserve me""I want to move on but it will be very difficult to survive with one kidney😔"
"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny."
"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ₹ 84900. After credit card discount(₹6000), old phone exchange(₹3450) and reward points money(₹4530) inclusion, I bought it for ₹70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I’ve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"
"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."
"Pros:there are 1000s of blog for prosCons:Apple has to work to improve their battery lifeCharger ! Charger ! Charger ! If apple really cares about environment so much then they must deliver a phone once in 3 years. Or, give the users a usb c.Don’t rely on their screen advertising. Use a cover. Glass is still a glass and you can observe scratches after a month of usage.5g isn’t for India, still price in terms of dollars was same!"
"Really happy with the purchase. But 2x zoom missing does make a little difference. Performance, Display, camera and battery are on point and that what matters the most to me. I was planning on buying the pro model but this year it was insanely expensive. So Bought this and saved some money for decent accessories. The value for money is great for the 128gb version."
Face id not proper  working Bluetooth fully not working  after 20days date of purchasing
hey called ceremic shield but it’s not for scratchless!!!!! I have so many scratches in my phone.......pls use tempered glass for protection of scratches!!!!!
"Amazing iPhone, worthy updatehave to buy a type-c supported charging adaptor for charginggood displaydecent battery lifenice night clicksoverall worthy upgrade from classic iPhonebuy apple original 20w adaptor for charging, it fill battery faster than any other adaptor"
"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."
Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There’s something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.
ProsVery good build qualityLight WeightFits in hands perfectly (even though it is 6.1 inch)Excellent DisplayDolby Vision HDR video recordingAmazing CameraSmooth performance for Everthing5GWell optimized SoftwareFace Id works perfectly even in dark roomWireless chargingConsOnly 18W chargingNo charger in the box..If this is environment friendly why are they selling it separately on websiteNo clear case in the box..(it would have been a complete package)No type C to type C connectorSlightly expensive (it should have been around 70k)
Price is high and packing is torn and scratched
"Overall it looks good, coming from XR it looks a good upgrade for me. Design is ‘back to basics’ which is compelling. I loved the fast response among other things."
"Worst camera and graphics if you compare pubg in oneplus mobiles and this phone, this phone’s graphics was worst like oppo phone graphics. And coming camera compare to this phone oppo is better phone than this. If apple continue like this this oneplus will lead the market."
"kes:ios- efficient and tidy.5G; Jio gives 4G+ currently to 5G mobiles as of 27-Dec-2020.The chassis feels different than rest phones in a good way.OLED display feels good to view.Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.Dislikes:Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.Here's my 2 cents:I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.Please use your discretion.Thanks."
"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience."
"he hardware- cameras, spatial audio system, built and chip- are really really good. Better than any other high end phone in the market.The iOS software is really awesome! With features like shortcuts, siri among others- this phone is the smartest smart phone in the market. It just does things for you in the background to give you the unique user experience that android has not been able to give so far. I switched from an android phone (OnePlus) to this and it has been a very refreshing and wonderful change."
Phone is awesome no doubt camera also as expected Smooth phoneBut There is no adaptor charger iphone provide only data cable people spend 85k and then again spend for 2k for charger that is very inappropriate this is not good people will not buy if this will continue providing not charger. What’s the meaning of phone people buy phone and don’t have charger to charge the phone first experience is mine for iphone is very bad because of charger. Because new c type adaptor is not getting everywhere how people will charge his phone. 85000 is a big amount so thing about it and provide full sets of charger.
"What a masterpiece this phone is! Coming from a flagship Android phone, this looked like a big leap. It’s totally next level. What a display, what an operating system, what a processor, what a camera! This is not only a phone but master of all. Wow. It’s an engineering marvel from Apple Inc."
"Excellent phone. I have been using iPhone since iPhone 4s was launchediPhone 12 is exceptionally good phone with a lovely screen. colours are vivid and elaborate.I am pretty heavy user of my phone on a daily basis and the battery really lasts for the whole day comfortably, actually I do not have to worry regarding my battery in spite of heavy usage.Camera is very good and takes perfect picture especially the portrait mode which is actually superb.Buttery smooth operating system and iOS 14.3 is superb. I actually do not feel the difference with 120 Hz refresh rate. The phone does not really lag at all, the dual SIM capability is also lovely and helpful."
Good product it is little bit smaller than iphone 11 and iphone xr design is nice it is litter colour than xr and iphone 11 i face issue that face id is opening by my brother face.it is fixed after reset the face id.
"Screen size bit small.....otherwise fantastic display, fantastic sound and masterpiece 👌👌👌.....but tim cook could have given charger and earphone"
"All I phone models are premium phones, coming to 12 price is to costly, but the quality is awesome.Camera, display,  processor and look of the body is premium.One think I don’t like is, phone is not coming with adapter and the headphonesOver rating for this iPhone 12 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
All things are at its place.. giving it 4 star just because of not giving power adapter with the cell phone. with this huge amount of price we actually deserve a power adapter.
"his is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one."
"I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors- Smooth app flow and transitions- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)-  Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving."
a day use it starts hanging just using whatsapp and instagram on it and its hanged ... worst experience
"Amazing product and very nice quality.I usually never order electronics online, i always buy it from a physical store. This time i checked everywhere for 256gb iphone 12 but it was out of stock and i had no option but to buy it online.I was a bit worried about the fraud and fake products but when i opened the package I realised that this cannot be fake."
"Camera quality is excellent, battery life is also ok. Compare to android not much. But good  recently  quite. I am first time user, apple  company sells now separate every part business like .  This is not corect"
I am so happy to have this device.. It feels too premium.. Blazing fast and ultra premium.. Loved it 😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
Well i dont have to say much because my phone is working perfect so i would just say go for it if you really think you can buy this phone. Dont worry its worth having it. Its been almost 1 month and i havent face any issue even battery backup is fine for me.
12 vanilla is the phone to buy for the average user. Its the sweet spot for 🍎 fans. If you really want the 3 cameras go for the pro max.
"Excellent performance, all apps open up almost instantly. Battery life is great. Gets around 4.5-5 hrs screen time with 47% remaining (last checked). Initially while restoring from iCloud it would consume a lot of battery. Give it a day or two. It would settle down."
What i am feeling is there is some difference buying products on amazon and stores directly. I have compared with my friends battery life has huge change she gets a day and mine ends within 7-8 hours
"I want to say that battery backup of iPhone has been considerably improved. Everything is the best. If you're a average user who only indulge in social life and little bit of photography no need to go for Pro/ Pro Max, iPhone 12 will do the justice."
1st thing is there is no USB adapterI.e. u need to buy adapter and it will cost u around 500Also no EarphonesApple has became very worse
If you have iphone 11/XR not much of a change expect the change in look from outside . From inside its still functions the same.Battery like : Can be improved. Okayish currently.Value of money: Not really. 80k INR is a lot of money.
Great phone. The battery improves after a few cycles
"his phone is little bit expensive and the baddest thing there is no charging adapter on box, apple charging this much money for this phone without giving important accessories like charging adapter, 😡"
his iPhone is amazingly good and camera is awesome. I will update about battery after few days of usage.
"So far loving my new iPhone.The battery life is good. Just need to charge once a day. I used my camera for recording videos for 2-3 hours , still the battery survived through out the day.Camera is good."
"Changed from iPhone X, Got the new blue colour, something unique from apple. Great battery backup and the edges now look too premium. Overall, such a great buy 🤩"
"Apple has dropped ear phone and charger  adapter from pack. Charger adapter are required for first time users. Atleast there should be an option to.Whatsup and FB should be part of started apps now.It's too early to comment on newer model, but nothing much changes as far as UI is concerned it still same icons which were ther for iphone 5. Doesn't feel you are bpught phone 4 years ago."
"Firstly it’s thin, weight is reduced. Apple changed the display to Super Retina edge-to-edge OLED now. It features Ceramic Shield to protect from hardest falls and drops. You are definitely going to love the edges this time. A good option to upgrade from previous models."
y first iPhone..... I m not satisfied with 12
What an upgrade for me from my almost 6 year old Iphone 6 to Iphone 12. Worth every penny. Bought the 128GB blue here on Amazon and got delivery in just 3 days. Perfect phone for my needs and feels solid when holding it on hand. The display and feel - So much satisfied with Iphone 12VERY VERY HAPPY.
"got it on my birthday, Thanks Jejus :D"
Great device. Amazing Cameras. Battery is good for a day. I don’t play games so I’m not sure about it.
"I love my iPhone 12Battery superb it will last for whole dayScreen Oled rocksUpgrading from 7 n it’s worth waiting.It will be better If Mrp is little lower 😉 like 70,000"
"Impeccable phone from apple, upgraded from iPhone 7. Battery could have been a little longer though"
"I love my iphone 12 so very much. Excellent display, battery life and camera and a14 processor chip is outstanding. Only one demerit and that is the cost of the phone. It's very expensive. Cheers..."
y phone power key not working after 20 days use ..now m helpless where m going for bacause amazon gives 10 day replacement only and iphone store so far from I’m lived
Super duper hit👍👌😍🥰
he new Apple iPhone 12 is an amazing device. The device is beautiful and performance is great.
"Very good product. I was using 6S plus till now. After using for one and half month, it’s so impressive and battery is the best. It comes whole day. Very fast and smooth. Nice design."
Average battery life only for iPhone for 1 day or below .Value for money is too expensive only but the quality is good comparing with the price .
Superbbb phone.First time I am using I phone feeling better experience with I phone 12.if u will use i phone 12 then u never buy stupid oppo Vivo like android phone
Upgraded from Iphone X to 12.Hassle free data transfer.
"Smooth, clean , fast,simple and class.Except for the front camera which is a bit underwhelming to me considering the price point and brand value,this is a beast of a device."
"I Loved I Phone X, because of size & design !!This one better in both aspects, it’s a very light phone !!"
"Overall iPhone is very nice but battery life is very very bad and phone getting heat,also camera is problem when in night mode."
Iphone 12 is by far the best iPhone no wonder why its getting all the praises from everyone. Thanks amazon for smooth delivery.
Everything is ok except a small hair scratch on front display glass.
Price is bit high
Best in class but a bit over priced.
"Super Duper iPhone 12 I Love it,It’s World Bigest Brand Smart Phone"
Better build quality as compared to iphone 11 but the camera is good in iphone 11 as compared to this one.

"After costing a huge amount iPhone 12 will not support 5G mmWave in India, which is the fastest 5G. So, before purchasing be cautious about the fact.."
Country of origin chinaChina manufacturing that much cost waste money on that product wasteKeep love ur parents not gadgets
"No Charging adapter, No earphones and charging cable is not enough lenghty.Hmm looks like the day is not far when Apple will sell the iphones without a box. lol"
"I got it from Apple online india, People who say battery life is not good they are just laying battery life is good for heavy user it will last full day, for gamers 5.5 to 6.5 hours on continuous uses. price is higher but everything good and well built and software experience is good, sound and display is excellent. normal 4g is 60 to 70 faster than any other phones. price is higher but its a great phone."
"Again a premium build. Nice to hold. Camera performance is really good. 6 to 8 hrs screen on time. Perfect size, not too small or not too big."
he ceramic shield they say is only for glass unbreakable thing and it doesnot cover scratches .Had a small scratch on screen display just in day 1 of use and when i searched online solution then i found i am not the only one.This problem is facing by many iphone 12 and pro customers
I bought this product from the showroom but now we shifted from there to a different flat so i can't give the showroom the review. So I am giving it here to help other customers decide. This phone is really awesome! Good job apple. Its better than how I had expected it! Awesome product totally recommend to buy it!
"Although i have purchased from retail ..but the device performance is excellant.. I used to upgrade from XR to 12..and significantly notices the difference in viewing angle aspect as well as day to day use.. As per power management  stat after using 17 hrs, 20 percent battery left .. camera is flawless in daylight/ artificial lighting also superb night mode.. you can see the picture of white flowers taken in night mode.. Although i thought there will be no major difference in XR and 12 display, but it matters!!! You can observ the difference while viewing any high resolution and colourful content. Stereo sound improvment also found from my previous device.. But altough it is bit overpriced.. But any i phone user planning to upgrade from it’s older siblings he will not be disappointed and will enjoy the one handed opearation"
Pros:*Blue looks pretty & odd compare to other models 💙*Weightless ❤️*U never feel like 60Hz smooth & it felt 120Hz display. Play all games with high quality display ❤️*Never lag/hang up anywhere & anytime.*Portrait does the job in detail.Cons:*Battery should be upgraded.. 2815mAh is not enough. 😣*Don’t upgrade from iPhone 11.. worthless!!🤔*Don't go for iPhone 12 Pro/Max.. money waste & useless.. 12 is enough to do a lot.
Perfectness in every inch. Great battery backup and great display. Every thing is perfect. Green colour awesome for light colour lovers. Blue and red are too dark.
"One of the best phone to switch-to for first time IOS users, great for Gamers, Normal users with Fb, Insta, Songs Videos etc. Don't expect the best battery life with it, However if you use 20 Wat charger the phone would get charged soon."
his is my 2nd Apple IPhone. Before I had IPhone SE(1st model)+Looks Awesome+Amazing Battery Backup+Great Touch and Display+Sound Quality is Awesome+Superb Build Quality-Mobile gets heat-Camera could have been better-Must have included Charging Adopter in Box
I am using it since two weeks and everything is so good so farI use screen around 6 to 8 hours and still battery lasts for another half day.Tips to over come the heat issue while charging1) close all the apps2)don’t charge after use. Let’s the mobile cool down and then plug in3) follow battery cycle. I only charge when the battery is 5% and plug out after it is full4)use 20 Watts adapter for better battery performance
I bought it on 21st Nov 2020.Pros -New box type design differentiates it with earlier recent  models.Best OLED display. 60Htz refresh rate doesn’t really matter.Light weight. Nice grip and easy to operate by one hand.Less thickness than iPhone 11.5G enabled.Having all necessary  features of pro model so value for money .Perfect 6.1 inch screen sizeVery good battery lifeFastest Bionic A14 chip processor.HDR photosDolby HDR videosBrighter display than iPhone 11.Cons -No charger in boxStill comes with lightening port and not C type port
"Phone 12 is the golden mean in all the iPhone 12 seriesBattery lasts for about a day.In Performance section, as usual, Apple is the best.It’s OLED display is mind blowing.Even though it is 5G compatible, 4G also works better.Don’t buy 64 GB as it will choke you much earlier as people tend to use iPhones for long times."
hone of 2020 for sure.combine it with the apple 20 w adapter and it will give 0 to 100 in less than 50 mins
Just A great phone don't buy it.(Just writing this because I need more words for submitting this review heeeeee aaa
Awesome battery life and camera was too good specially portrait mode is awesome.A14 bionic chip is awesome 😍i love it🔥
Waste of money display quality also poor and battery is very worst than iphone 11 pls dont buy it and waste your money
Phones below 10knhabe better displays.Good camera but not the best.Just another marketing skill every fool falls for everyday
BEST PHONE OF 2020... UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 6 TO 12.. ITS A JUMP ...BEST CAMERA ... VIDEO QUALITY IS SUPERB
Beautiful phone with amazing battery life and camera quality. Face id works perfectly. Blue colour is very vibrant and stylish.Go for it
"Well it’s getting lots of hate and shame because of them removing the charger from the box when they know that 1 or 2 years later they will do the same, just like the headphone jack."
"Excellent device, beautiful iOS, AMOLED display and design. The only drawback for me coming from Android devices with massive batteries is that this only has a single day battery while I am used to more."
"Battery is good, value for money is lite expensive and finally iphone E sim network is till not working properly,"
he A14 Bionic chip is indeed amazing. The sharp edges are a true beauty indeed. The camera performance is astonishing as well :)
Iphone 12 is amazing. It’s so fast. It has 5G network  which is so fast. Design is soo good. Excellent pixels. Camera is good. Must go for it
his is the best Phone on the Market Right Now ...  U can definitely check it out... & Go for it !!!
Best iOs phone if you have budget of 75k Amd  better than samsungs flaships mobile If uh want then just go for it
"Gorgeous display, excellent camera quality and its worlds fastest phone, looks beautiful and feels premium in hand. The only downside is price in India. Lightning speed delivery with Amazon."
Great phone. But its costlier. Camera is best part. Battery life is great. Very light to hold. I love iphone.
Battery is worse 11 is batter then 12 battery drain to first i charge 100 % and i use to play a music in 1 or to minut the battery is down to first

Amazing product...by apple good camera quality look premium best phone of the year 2020.  Good deal from Amazon that's all
I love iPhoneMy first choice was iPhone 12 buy iPhone my choice I love iPhone my best choice for apple
"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here"
"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."
"hanks to Amazon n the seller for early delivery. I have used this phone from the last 10 days n it’s absolutely stunning, beautiful n the beast..Camera is awesome n the night mode is fabulous. I have upgraded from iPhone 6s. No other phone in the current market can outdo it. Though it’s expensive but you won’t regret to buy if u can afford.I have seen a lot of other negative comments n they r android users. I will be using this ph for another 5 to 6 years."
Just great! Initially heating issue with it but I learnt that it’s due to initial setup process! Now it’s just a monster!
"Completely satisfied with the performance , Camera and Battery life. But display totally disappointed me. There is an extra yellow tint for the display and colors are off. I am a photographer and colour grading artist. So accurate color reproduction is of almost importance to me. Please reconsider your decision if you are in similar profession"
Back to the same design of iPhone 4/5. Phone feels great to hold and use. Very snappy and good battery life. Records video in HDR which looks really good on the oled screen of the phone.
"ks premium on hand, Fastest mobile on the planet right now and definitely worthy.Battery life is good compared to other flagship mobiles.Camera is outstanding, apple always does the same with iPhone series.Always in love with apple products still love continues😍😍😍😍"
"here's enough written about the iPhone already, what I liked was the user experience of buying from Amazon rather than from a store."
Awesome photo and video quality.Performance is the top notch.as usual awesome iOS.
Perfect one because iphone is iphone....
Good one first time using
It looks stylish. the camera quality is beyond expectations
